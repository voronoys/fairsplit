## Quick reading: Highlights

Soccer is the most popular sport in Brazil and before every (non-professional) match, a task is necessary: split the teams. 
A common way to do it is to choose as many captains as the number of teams. They have the role to select their teams based 
on their previous knowledge about the players' skills. The algorithm starts with one of these captains selecting one player among all
available ones. After that, it is time for the next captain to start selecting their team and again another player is selected among 
all available players. The algorithm keeps going until all the players are allocated to a team.

Usually, the last captain has a less strong team as the others captains have already selected the best players before.
Also, the 'best player' can be someone good in one specific position and the concept itself is completely subjective. 
The same situation is rapidly applicable to other sports as volleyball, handball, basketball and so on. However, the task of creating teams 
is not just applied to sports. It is common to have teams in a company, for example. In such a case, the teams are defined based on the needs 
of each project and as a consequence their allocated employees' skills.

## Algorithm

We implemented a simple and useful iterative method. For each individual, a set of attributes is collected, and, based on them, 
teams are created ensuring that the overall teams' metrics are similar. To do so, individuals are splitted into teams and teams' similarity is calculated. After this, new settings are proposed and we keep the one in which the similarity is the biggest.

As a result, we have competitive teams with similar characteristics which can ensure a more enjoyable match.
